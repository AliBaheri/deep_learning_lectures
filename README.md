# Deep Learning (lab) lectures

This repository contains the laboratory lectures relative to Deep Learning written for the course of Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 2016.

This repository is built upon the previous (amazing) work of [Lorenzo Baraldi](http://www.lorenzobaraldi.com/) which you can find [here](https://github.com/baraldilorenzo/DL_tutorials).
