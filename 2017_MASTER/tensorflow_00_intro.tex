	\begin{itemize}
	\item Python API
	\item Flexible enough for research, yet built with production use in mind
	\item Portable on heterogeneous systems, from mobile devices to large-scale distributed machines, and on a variety of OS (Android, Windows, iOS, ...).
	\item TensorBoard visualization has no rival.
	\item Large community and supported by Google.
